# Course Diary: Analog Integrated Circuit Design

### January 15, 2025
Today's lecture on operational amplifiers generated good discussion. Students struggled with understanding virtual ground concept - need to develop better visualization next time. The analysis of the inverting amplifier configuration sparked interesting questions about input impedance.

### January 22, 2025
Covered active filters. The cascade vs. feedback approaches to higher-order filters led to great debate. Must remember to emphasize pole placement visualization more clearly next lecture. Several students noted connections to their co-op experiences with filter design.

### January 29, 2025
Feedback analysis session went well. The concept of loop gain caused some confusion - will bring oscilloscope next time to demonstrate phase margins. Need to add more real-world stability examples from industry.

### February 5, 2025
Strong engagement during noise analysis lecture. The thermal noise calculations sparked good questions about Johnson noise in resistors. Must remember to clarify correlation between bandwidth and noise next session - students seemed unclear on this relationship.

### February 12, 2025
Complex frequency response topics today. Students grasped Bode plots well but struggled with root locus interpretations. The MATLAB demonstrations helped visualize pole-zero movements. Consider adding more interactive simulations next term.

### February 19, 2025
Mixed-signal interfacing concepts today. ADC/DAC architectures generated intense discussion. Several students shared internship experiences with data conversion challenges. Need more examples of sampling effects next time.

### February 26, 2025
Lab session on differential amplifiers. Students struggled with common-mode rejection ratio measurements. Good troubleshooting opportunities arose from mismatched resistors. Will prepare better debug guidelines for next year.

### March 5, 2025
Power amplifier design considerations. Thermal management concepts were particularly engaging. Need to bring heat sink examples next time. Student questions about crossover distortion led to great discussion about bias circuits.

### March 12, 2025
Oscillator stability analysis today. Students grasped Barkhausen criteria well but phase noise concepts need more clarity. The crystal oscillator demo was effective - keep this for next term.

### March 19, 2025
RF amplifier concepts introduced. Smith chart tutorials took longer than expected - need to develop better visualization tools. Students appreciated the practical examples from modern wireless devices.

### March 26, 2025
Project proposals presented today. Impressive range of analog applications - from audio processing to sensor interfaces. Need to emphasize specification writing more clearly next year.

### April 2, 2025
Low noise design techniques covered. Students particularly engaged with chopper amplifier concepts. The noise figure calculations need more practice problems - add to problem set.

### April 9, 2025
Analog layout techniques discussion. Students struggled with matching concepts. The virtual fab tour videos helped illustrate process variations. Add more real mask examples next time.
