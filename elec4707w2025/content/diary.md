# Course Diary: Analog Circuit Design

## January 15, 2025
Today's lecture on operational amplifiers generated good discussion. Students struggled with understanding virtual ground concept - need to develop better visualization next time. The analysis of the inverting amplifier configuration sparked interesting questions about input impedance.

Covered active filters. The cascade vs. feedback approaches to higher-order filters led to great debate. Must remember to emphasize pole placement visualization more clearly next lecture. Several students noted connections to their co-op experiences with filter design.

Feedback analysis session went well. The concept of loop gain caused some confusion - will bring oscilloscope next time to demonstrate phase margins. Need to add more real-world stability examples from industry.

## February 5, 2025
Strong engagement during noise analysis lecture. The thermal noise calculations sparked good questions about Johnson noise in resistors. Must remember to clarify correlation between bandwidth and noise next session - students seemed unclear on this relationship.

Complex frequency response topics today. Students grasped Bode plots well but struggled with root locus interpretations. The MATLAB demonstrations helped visualize pole-zero movements. Consider adding more interactive simulations next term.
